## LAB 2: Analyzing a monolithic application (Aaron)

In this lab we will create a container image from an existing application. We will build, run and inspect the container. Then we will analyze the services to understand how the various services interact. 

Expected completion: 10-20 minutes

* Review Dockerfile
* run it, confirm connectivity
* docker ps; docker inspect
* docker images
* curl
